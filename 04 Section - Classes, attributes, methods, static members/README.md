# 04 Section - Classes, attributes, methods, static members

    - This section was a recap to classes, attributes, methods, static members.

### Class

- It is a structured type that can contain (members): -
  • Attributes (data / fields);
  • Methods (functions/operations);

- The class can also provide many other features, such as:
  • Constructors;
  • Overload;
  • Encapsulation;
  • Heritage;
  • Polymorphism;

- Examples:
  • Entities: Product, Client, Triangle;
  • Services: ProductService, ClientService, EmailService, StorageService;
  • Controllers: ProductController, ClientController;
  • Utilities: Calculator, Compactor;
  • Others (views, repositories, managers, etc.);

### Attributes

    - An attribute is a declarative tag that is used to convey information to runtime about the behaviors of various elements like classes, methods, structures, enumerators, assemblies etc. in your program. You can add declarative information to a program by using an attribute. A declarative tag is depicted by square ([ ]) brackets placed above the element it is used for.

    - Attributes are used for adding metadata, such as compiler instruction and other information such as comments, description, methods and classes to a program. The .Net Framework provides two types of attributes: the pre-defined attributes and custom built attributes.

### Methods

    - A method is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C# program has at least one class with a method named Main.

### Static members

    - We difine a member as static using the "static" keyword;
    - When we declare a member of a class as static it means no matter how many objects of the class are created, there is only one copy of the static member.
    - A static member is shared by all objects of the class;
