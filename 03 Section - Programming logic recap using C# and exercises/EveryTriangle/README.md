# Area of ​​Solids

    - Make a program that reads three double-precision floating point values: A, B, and C. Then calculate and show:
    a) the area of ​​the right triangle that has A as its base and C as its height.
    b) the area of ​​the circle of radius C. (pi = 3.14159)
    c) the area of ​​the trapezoid that has A and B for bases and C for height.
    d) the area of ​​the square that has side B.
    e) the area of ​​the rectangle that has sides A and B.
